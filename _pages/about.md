I am a first year PhD student at the University of California, San Diego working with [Nadia Polikarpova](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~npolikarpova/).
I believe robust type systems and better interfaces to programming will be the most fruitful avenues to making fewer mistakes.
**I want to make it harder to write bad code.**

To this end, I'm currently working on program synthesis. My projects are Hoogle+, a type-driven, component-based synthesis tool for Haskell; and,
I'm also working to extend Synquid with examples to make synthesis with refinement types a little less painful.
