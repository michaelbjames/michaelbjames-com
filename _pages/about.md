I want to make it harder to write bad code.
---
I believe robust type systems and better interfaces to code will be the most fruitful avenues.
To this end, I'm working on program synthesis with [Nadia
Polikarpova]({{site.data.authors.Nadia_Polikarpova.uri}}) at the University of
California, San Diego.


## I'm looking for a Summer 2020 internship!
