Teaching Assistant for [Kathleen Fisher](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~kfisher/Kathleen_Fisher/Home.html)'s programming languages course.
I led a weekly recitation for students to better understand the semantic differences between imperative and functional programming languages.
I helped to grade student homework assignments and tests.
