While program synthesis with refinement types as a specification is rather
precise, it is not
expressive enough for even some simple programs. However, synthesis with
examples as a specification
can be fatiguingly verbose, with some programs requiring many more
examples than lines of code in the solution---rendering the synthesis a moot point.

I propose a middle ground of these two styles that offers both the expressive
power of examples and the generality of refinement types. I call this style of
program specification, _partial refinements_.

Powered by an intersection type, I will empower refinement types to include a
specific example (or many) as part of the specification.
I expect this to simplify the specification for some queries (like `filter`).
Stay tuned to see this in a future conference!
