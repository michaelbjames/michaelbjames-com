I discussed [Hoogle+](http://goto.ucsd.edu/hoogle_plus), one of my research
projects. It is a component-based type-driven synthesis technique for Haskell.
Relying on a library of everyday functions and an input type query, the system finds an inhabitant of the, potentially polymorphic, type using those provided component set. The search tames an explosion of infinite types through a novel type-guided abstraction refinement (TYGAR) approach.

This lead to our [type-guided abstraction refinement (TYGAR) paper]({% link _publications/2019-11-11-hoogle-plus.md %})
