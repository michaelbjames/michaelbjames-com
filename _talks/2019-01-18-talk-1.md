In this talk I presented [Hoogle+](http://goto.ucsd.edu/hoogle_plus), a component-based type-driven synthesis technique for Haskell.
Relying on a library of everyday functions and an input type query, the system finds an inhabitant of the, potentially polymorphic, type using those provided component set. The search tames an explosion of infinite types through a novel type-guided abstraction refinement (TYGAR) approach.

We have a paper under review and will be posted when accepted.
