Program synthesis searches from a high level specification to find a program
that matches a userâ€™s intent. Interactive program synthesis considers the human
an essential part of that search process. Providing interactions comes in
largely two forms: there are interactions that serve to get information into the
system and those that get information out from the synthesizer. In some
synthesizers, that output information also works to solicit new information
which in turn refines the search, making for an interaction loop with the
synthesizer. In this work, I classify interactions to gather information into,
out of, and form loops of synthesis systems while fitting my ongoing work into
this research landscape. I look at this interaction loop in the context of
interaction theory. I conclude by highlighting open questions and areas
for improvement in search interactions.
